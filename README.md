# CO2-Emissions
WTFC'23 Data Science track collaborative mini project with Sonia Anthony

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This number can vary based on a vehicleâ€™s fuel, fuel economy,  number of miles driven per year and other features. 

The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is one of the main causes of global warming. It is therefore important to reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles by making regulations to minimize their impact on the environment.
## Aim
The aim of this study is to draft recommendations for guidelines on CO2 emissions rules and to determine the vehicles that produces lower emissions.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset
The dataset containing seven years of CO2 emissions details for Canadian vehicles gotten from the Government of Canada's open [data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6)
was used.

The features in the dataset are:
- "Make" - The company that manufactures the vehicle.

- "Model" - The vehicle's model.

- "Vehicle Class" - Vehicle class by utility, capacity, and weight.

- "Engine Size(L)" - The engine's displacement in liters.

- "Cylinders" - The number of cylinders.

- "Transmission" - The transmission type: A = Automatic, AM = Automatic Manual, AS = Automatic with select shift, AV = Continuously variable, M = Manual, 3 - 10 = the number of gears.

- "Fuel Type" - The fuel type: X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel, E = Ethanol (E85), N = natural gas.

- "Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)" - Combined city/highway (55%/45%) fuel consumption in liters per 100 km (L/100 km).

- "CO2 Emissions(g/km)" - The tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer for combined city and highway driving.


## Research Questions

1. What is the median engine size in liters?
2. What is the average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (Fuel Type = X), premium gasoline (Z), ethanol (E), and diesel (D)?  
3. What is the correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?
4. Which vehicle class has lower average CO2 emissions, 'SUV - SMALL' or 'MID-SIZE'? 
5. What are the average CO2 emissions for all vehicles? For vehicles with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller?
6. What are vehicle Make, Model and Vehicle class with the highest and lowest CO2 emission.


## âœ… Recommendations

- Vehicles with smaller engine size, smaller cylinders, AM6 and AV6 transmissions and less fuel consumptions should be used more often. These vehicles are highly efficient and minimise carbon footprint. 

- Production of vehicles with big engine sizes, large cylinders, higher fuel consumptions and transmissions that emit more COÂ² should be regulated and their purchases should come at a high cost. This would minimise purchase to a few thereby ensuring COÂ² emission rate is low.

- Regular gasoline should be made more affordable.

- Tax advantages for other fuel types should be removed. 

- Alternative fuels e.g renewable fuels, electricity should be encouraged.

- Use of public transportation such as buses, trams, trains should be 
encouraged through discounts and fare subsidies. This would ensure that less COÂ² is emitted as there would be less use of vehicles by individuals.

- Individuals should go for fuel efficient vehicles.

- Car manufacturers especially Bugatti makers should work towards reducing the carbon emitted by the different models they manufacture.
