# CO2-Emissions
WTFC'23 Data Science track collaborative mini project

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This number can vary based on a vehicleâ€™s fuel, fuel economy,  number of miles driven per year and other features. 

The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is one of the main causes of global warming. It is therefore important to reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles by making regulations to minimize their impact on the environment.
## Aim
The aim of this study is to draft recommendations for guidelines on CO2 emissions rules and to determine the vehicles that produces lower emissions.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset
The dataset containing seven years of CO2 emissions details for Canadian vehicles gotten from the Government of Canada's open [data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6)
was used.

The features in the dataset are:
- "Make" - The company that manufactures the vehicle.

- "Model" - The vehicle's model.

- "Vehicle Class" - Vehicle class by utility, capacity, and weight.

- "Engine Size(L)" - The engine's displacement in liters.

- "Cylinders" - The number of cylinders.

- "Transmission" - The transmission type: A = Automatic, AM = Automatic Manual, AS = Automatic with select shift, AV = Continuously variable, M = Manual, 3 - 10 = the number of gears.

- "Fuel Type" - The fuel type: X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel, E = Ethanol (E85), N = natural gas.

- "Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)" - Combined city/highway (55%/45%) fuel consumption in liters per 100 km (L/100 km).

- "CO2 Emissions(g/km)" - The tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer for combined city and highway driving.
